1. Vectorize Operations with NumPy
Current: Some loops (e.g., sensitivity calculation) are written in Python for-loops.
Optimization: Use NumPy vectorized operations to compute distances, costs, and sensitivities for all points at once. This can provide a significant speedup, especially for large point clouds.
2. Avoid Repeated KMeans
Current: KMeans is run if labels are not present.
Optimization: If you’re compressing multiple times (e.g., for different sample sizes or t values), cache the clustering results and reuse them.
3. Parallelize Expensive Steps
Current: All operations are single-threaded.
Optimization: Use multiprocessing or joblib to parallelize:
Sensitivity calculations for clusters.
Sampling for different clusters (especially in the upgraded method).
KMeans itself (scikit-learn’s KMeans supports n_jobs).
4. Smarter Cluster Summarization
Current: Cheap clusters are summarized by their mean.
Optimization: For very large clusters, consider summarizing with more than just the mean (e.g., a small local coreset or a few representative points).
5. Adaptive t Selection
Current: t is a fixed parameter.
Optimization: Automatically select t based on a threshold for cluster cost (e.g., summarize all clusters whose cost is below a certain fraction of the total cost).
6. Use More Efficient Data Structures
Current: Uses lists and dictionaries for some operations.
Optimization: Use NumPy arrays or pandas DataFrames for all point and label storage and manipulation.
7. Reduce Memory Footprint
Current: All points and clusters are kept in memory.
Optimization: For very large point clouds, process data in chunks or use memory-mapped arrays.
8. Use Approximate Nearest Neighbors
Current: Full distance calculations for clustering and sensitivity.
Optimization: Use approximate nearest neighbor libraries (e.g., Annoy, Faiss) for faster cluster assignment and distance calculations.
9. Algorithmic Improvements
Leverage advanced coreset constructions: There are more recent coreset algorithms for k-means that may offer better trade-offs between speed and accuracy (e.g., lightweight coresets, streaming coresets).
Hybrid approaches: Combine sensitivity sampling with other reduction techniques (e.g., grid-based downsampling for very dense regions).
10. Profile and Benchmark
Current: No profiling.
Optimization: Use Python’s cProfile or line_profiler to find bottlenecks in your code, then focus optimization efforts where they matter most.
